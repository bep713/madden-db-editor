# madden-db-editor

> This is the source code for the Madden DB editor.

This project was made using Electron, Node.js, Vue, and other front end technologies. It is a re-make of the original Madden DB Editor created by Xanathol which can be found here: https://forums.operationsports.com/forums/madden-nfl-last-gen-rosters/579625-madden-roster-editor-v1.html. I am not Xan and haven't been in contact with him while making this. Without his open source editor, though, this wouldn't have been possible. Thank you!
